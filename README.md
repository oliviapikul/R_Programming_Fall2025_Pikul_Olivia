Friedman is an R package I created to simplify the cleaning, summarizing, and visualizing of survey and experimental data. It is intended for students, researchers, and data analysts who work with messy datasets and need efficient tools to prepare data for analysis and presentation. The package includes functions such as clean_na(), which identifies and either replaces or removes missing values, summarize_data(), which produces descriptive statistics for numeric and categorical variables, summary_plot(), which generates visual summaries using ggplot2, and compare_groups(), which compares statistics across demographic or experimental groups and creates related visualizations. It also includes new_csv(), a function that exports cleaned datasets into CSV or Excel files. Friedman relies on ggplot2 for visualizations, dplyr for data manipulation, and tidyr for data cleaning. I selected the MIT license to encourage free use, modification, and distribution of the package. The GitHub repository contains the full source code and documentation.
